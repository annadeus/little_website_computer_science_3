## Project at the End of Computer Science 3
Our task was to create a small website using Django in groups of three. We had to implement one scenario from a set of three, which we selected beforehand based on our project idea. Our concept was to develop a small games app called 'Pixelground'. 

The scenarios we considered were 'Search for Game', 'View Bug Report', and 'View Profile'. Ultimately, we chose to implement 'Search for Game'. The design aspect was optional, and the website remains incomplete.
